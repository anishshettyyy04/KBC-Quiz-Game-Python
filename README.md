# KBC-Quiz-Game-Python
This is a Python quiz game modeled after Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC). Players answer multiple-choice questions, each associated with increasing prize amounts. If the player answers incorrectly, the game ends, and they keep the last guaranteed prize. The game demonstrates Python basics like lists, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
